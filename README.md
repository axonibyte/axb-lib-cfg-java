# Axonibyte Java Library Suite - Configuration

Copyright (c) 2023 Axonibyte Innovations, LLC. All rights reserved.

This Java library handles command line and file-based configuration loading for
Java projects. Libraries currently exist that parse command line argument, but
they are not particularly robust and are, in general, tedious to set up. This
library assists in making config mapping easier, while allowing for developers
to set config priorities (for example, when a user specifies a value for the same
parameter via both command line and file).
